Hello world, my name is Michael McFarland, and this is my blog.

### Who am I?

I'm a computer **programmer** whose been developing serious games, educational interactives
and web applications professionally for the last 6 years. I worked for a small
educational software start up, and got to wear many hats.

**Now I'm creating my own games**, starting with a multi-player puzzle strategy
game; code named it rains fish. Hopefully the first of many.

### What's this all about?
This blog will mainly be about **my games**, **programming**, and related tooling. I've
been working in unity3d and C#, I'm enamored by scala and haskell, and am
currently working in node js; So expect posts about them. 

### Why am I doing this?
First and foremost, I need to **get the word out about the game I'm making**.
So if you like what you see, or are feeling nice, please help out this little 
guy by spreading the word.

I also want to **give back to the community**. Most of the most helpful
resources I've read have been blog posts. They are unique dose of anecdotal
evidence practical example, and entertainment. Often eerily on topic, 
thanks to the countless others who have decided to spend the time to share.
